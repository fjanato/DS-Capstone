Predictive analytics is a category of data analytics aimed at making predictions about future outcomes based on historical data and analytics techniques such as statistical modeling and machine learning. [^1] 

Predictive analytics has captured the support of wide range of organizations, with a global market projected to reach approximately $10.95 billion by 2022, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 21 percent between 2016 and 2022, according to a 2017 report issued by Zion Market Research. [^2]

Organizations today use predictive analytics in a virtually endless number of ways. The technology helps adopters in fields as diverse as finance, healthcare, retailing, hospitality, pharmaceuticals, automotive, aerospace and manufacturing.

One of the organizations making use of predictive analytics is Aerospace, where is used to predict the impact of specific maintenance operations on aircraft reliability, fuel use, availability and uptime.

In this project well be using Predictive Analytics on a Dataset publicly made available by NASA [^3] to predict the amount of remaining use cycles in turbofan engines.
